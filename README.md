# LIT: auto-generator for contrast set

This is the code for out EMNLP 2020 paper: Linguistically-Informed Transformations (LIT): A Method forAutomatically Generating Contrast Sets



## Citation

Coming soon

## Processed Dataset

* We released the [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkqOg1Lk9VcaI5l-l1d6RHE_CBCTXl-A?usp=sharing) used in our paper.
  * Note: `orignal+basic` means (original [SNLI/MNLI] + basic [e.g. `i;i`] augmentation). Nothing like `+pa` is included, as that means compositional transformation.
* We will also release the MRS parses with which people can transform sentences by their defined perturbation.

**Note:** This is **not** complete parallel datasets of the original SNLI and MNLI. There are some sentences missing because the parser sometimes canâ€™t parse the representation. You might need to run your transformation on some missed out data.



## Environment setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lit
```



## Structure of Repo

`transfer`: module that contain all functions we mentioned in our paper. Within it, :

* `README.md` gives a detailed documentation of current config of our parser.

* `transfer_example.py` is an illustrative example of how to use our parser.
* `transfer_snli_parallel.py` is the script we used (some local modification needs to be made) to parse SNLI in parallel. Parallel processing is **strongly encouraged**

`post-process`: after processing the dataset, you need some cleaning of the parsed dataset to put in the right form.

* `making_sense.py` contains choices of sentence selectors in scoring different generated surface sentences
*  `process.py` contains functions that:
  * select generated sentences
  * apply defined rules to generate contrast set
